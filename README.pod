=head1 SYNOPSIS

Somewhere in your application's login process:

    use Net::Facebook::Oauth2;

    my $fb = Net::Facebook::Oauth2->new(
        application_id     => 'your_application_id', 
        application_secret => 'your_application_secret',
        callback           => 'http://yourdomain.com/facebook/callback'
    );

    # get the authorization URL for your application
    my $url = $fb->get_authorization_url(
        scope   => [ 'public_profile', 'email', 'offline_access', 'publish_stream' ],
        display => 'page'
    );

Now redirect the user to this C<$url>.

Once the user authorizes your application, Facebook will send him/her back
to your application, on the C<callback> link provided above.

Inside that callback route, use the verifier code parameter that Facebook
sends to get the access token:

    # param() below is a bogus function. Use whatever your web framework
    # provides (e.g. $c->req->param('code'), $cgi->param('code'), etc)
    my $code = param('code');

    my $access_token = $fb->get_access_token(code => $code);

If you got so far, your user is logged! Save this access token in your
database or session.

Later on you can use it to communicate with Facebook on behalf of this user:

    my $fb = Net::Facebook::Oauth2->new(
        access_token => $access_token
    );

    my $info = $fb->get(
        'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/me'   # Facebook API URL
    );

    print $info->as_json;
